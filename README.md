DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    --I developed advising assistance software for ABCU which would allow students to print schedule course information or a single course. This allows administration to load a course as necessary as well.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    -- I considered each data structure we reviewed and the runtime necessary for the software. Because vectors are dynamic, I decided to use a vector. This allowed me to parse the data stored at an efficient run time and pull the correct information.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    -- Courses may have 0 prerequisites while others may have up to 2, so handling that variable was difficult for me. After research, I decided to make my prerequisite a vector itself. When course information was chosen to print, I had to parse the prerequisite vector to print the correct associating course information - not a random prerequisite. It took a little bit for me to figure out but once I got it, it was easy.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    --This project has made me really appreciate algorithms along with the built in functions of C++. In using these, my code reusability has increased as well as my efficiency.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    --Understanding Big O notation and what it represents has made me change my coding practices. Proper syntax and industry best standards are requirements that I've instilled personally.
